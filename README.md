# GANs-Implementation
Fun Implementations of Different types of GANs

INITIALLY ADDED DC GAN for MNist Dataset and it performed really well in recreating hand written digits--

2--Using GANs to create Anime Faces with 2 different approaches
   Dataset Used from Kagle.
   a-  DCGAN
       the generated images uploaded are just early stages and will add more images with epochs done in the future as each epoch is very time consuming but expecting out put like this later-

   b-  StyleGAN2 (In Future)
   
   
Next 3 GANs-- (A Part of a long Term Project of automatic photo editing with AI which will be uploaded later as well as the GANs will be uploaded here) for Image Upscaling, Filters, Effects, Low Light Resolution, etc.
